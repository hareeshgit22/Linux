Prerequisites-What you should Know
what is os
why os in Embedded systems
why Linux
what are the components of os
Booting steps of os

Step-1) BIOS-Basic Input Output system(is )
check basic input output connections are connected or not
checking bootable device

Step-2) MBR-Master Boot Record
it is located in the 1st sector of the bootable disk.
MBR is less than 512 bytes in size.
it contains information about GRUB.
so in simple terms MBR loads and executes the GRUB boot loader.

Step-3)GRUB-Grand Unified Bootloader 
if you have multiple kernel images installed on your system ,you can choose which one to be excuted.
GRUB displays a splash screen,waits for few seconds,if you dont enter anything,it loads the default kernel image as specied in the grub configuration file.

Step-4)Kernel
Mount the root file system.
Kernel executes the /sbin/init program.
In simple term we can say os is loaded into RAM.

Step-5)Init
since init was the 1st first program to be excuted by linux kernel,it has the proces id(PID) is 1.
init identifies the default initlevel from /etc/inittab and uses that to load all appropriate program.

step-6) Run Level Programs
